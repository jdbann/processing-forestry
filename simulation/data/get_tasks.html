    <h2>Get Tasks</h2>

    <p>Now there&#8217;s not much point having these lumberjacks standing around. They get demotivated and start wandering around. In fact, they&#8217;re so desperate to find something to do that they will constantly ask you for tasks.</p>

<pre><code>GET /people/24f2caed-0fe4-48e6-adfc-a2ea2cd730cd/tasks
Host: localhost
Port: 4567
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>

    <p>You&#8217;ll notice that they each ask for their own tasks by adding their employee id to the path: <code>/people/:person_id/tasks</code>.</p>

    <h3>Speaking their language</h3>

    <p>You&#8217;ll notice that in this request, they&#8217;re specifically saying that they only accept <code>application/json</code>. So they&#8217;re looking for a valid JSON object in the body of your response.</p>

    <p>More specifically, they&#8217;re expecting this returned JSON object to include a <code>tasks</code> key with an array:</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;tasks&quot;: []
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>How to succeed</h3>

    <p>For now, we just need the lumberjacks to know that they are getting tasks correctly, but there isn&#8217;t anything for them to do.</p>

    <p>So, return a valid response when the lumberjack asks for new tasks.</p>
