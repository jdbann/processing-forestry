    <h2>200 Response</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Forestry! You are <strong>Head of Operations</strong> for a small patch of forest land. Your employees (lumberjacks) are eagerly awaiting instructions.</p>

    <p>However, they can only talk to you by making HTTP requests. So your first job is to write a server.</p>

    <h3>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for work!&#8221;</h3>

    <p>When a new lumberjack is ready to start work, they make an announcement. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>POST /people
Host: localhost
Port: 4567
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

id=24f2caed-0fe4-48e6-adfc-a2ea2cd730cd&amp;x=8&amp;y=11
</code></pre>

    <p>They provide you with their employee id and their current location as a form encoded string.</p>

    <p>Taking <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html">Sinatra</a> as an example, those details are already made available as your <code>params</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>params = {
  &quot;id&quot; =&gt; &quot;24f2caed-0fe4-48e6-adfc-a2ea2cd730cd&quot;,
  &quot;x&quot; =&gt; &quot;8&quot;,
  &quot;y&quot; =&gt; &quot;11&quot;
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>How to succeed</h3>

    <p>To complete this first challenge, you just need to give a <code>200</code> response for this request.</p>
